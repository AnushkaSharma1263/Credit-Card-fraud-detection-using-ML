Credit-Card-fraud-detection-using-ML
This repository contains an implementation of various machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Fraud detection is a critical task in the financial sector, aiming to minimize losses by identifying malicious activities in real-time.

Overview

Credit card fraud detection is a binary classification problem where the goal is to classify transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. This project explores machine learning algorithms to build an accurate and efficient fraud detection system.

Features

Data preprocessing and exploration

Imbalanced data handling using techniques like SMOTE

Implementation of multiple machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

Support Vector Machines

Dataset

The project uses the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, which contains anonymized transaction features and labeled transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

Technologies Used

Python

Libraries:

Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning models

Imbalanced-learn for handling class imbalance

Results

The best-performing model was Random Forest, achieving:

Precision: 98.5%

Recall: 94.3%

Other models like Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting also showed competitive performance.

Future Work

Implement deep learning techniques such as LSTMs for time-series analysis.

Test the model on live streaming data.

Incorporate additional datasets for better generalization.
